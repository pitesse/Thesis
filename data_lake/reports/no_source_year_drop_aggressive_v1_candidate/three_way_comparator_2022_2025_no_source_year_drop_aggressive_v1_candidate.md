## Caveats
- SDE, batch ML, and MOA decision rows are directly comparable under the fixed H=2 comparator contract.
- MOA prequential row remains useful as a stream quality baseline but is not itself a decision-level comparator metric.
- SHAP for MOA is surrogate-based and must be interpreted as behavior approximation, not MOA internal attribution.
